https://github.com/yourusername/HashCrack
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Render (FREE)
1. Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create a new **Web Service**
4. Select your forked repository
5. Set these values:
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `python enhanced_web_interface.py`
   - **Environment:** Python 3.9+
6. Deploy and note your URL (e.g., `https://your-app.render.com`)

#### Step 3: Configure Frontend
1. Edit `frontend/config.js`
2. Replace `YOUR_RENDER_URL_HERE` with your Render URL
3. Commit and push changes

#### Step 4: Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Pages** section
3. Set Source to **Deploy from a branch**
4. Select branch: `main`, folder: `/frontend`
5. Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/HashCrack/`

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Single Hash Cracking

```
Hash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
Type: MD5 (auto-detected)
Wordlist: RockYou
Result: "password" (found in 0.2 seconds)
```

### Example 2: Team CTF Scenario

**CTF Challenge:** "Crack these 5 NTLM hashes"

1. **Team Leader (Alice):**
   - Creates team "CyberNinjas"
   - Uploads CTF-specific wordlist
   - Assigns hash #1 to herself

2. **Team Member (Bob):**
   - Joins team via shared link
   - Takes hash #2 and #3
   - Starts distributed cracking

3. **Team Member (Carol):**
   - Joins team
   - Takes hash #4 and #5
   - Enables P2P to help Bob

4. **Results:**
   - Hash #1: Cracked by Alice in 30 seconds
   - Hash #2: Cracked by Bob in 2 minutes
   - Hash #3: Cracked by Bob+Carol P2P in 45 seconds
   - Hash #4: Cracked by Carol in 1 minute
   - Hash #5: Too complex, marked for later

**Team completes challenge in under 5 minutes!**

### Example 3: yescrypt Support

```
Hash: $y$j9T$salt$hash... (yescrypt)
Detection: "yescrypt - Latest Linux Password Hashing"
Security: Very High
Approach: GPU-accelerated cracking with custom wordlist
Result: Found using contextual password generation
```
