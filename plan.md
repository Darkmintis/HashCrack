# HashCrack V2.0 - Next-Generation All-in-One Hash Cracking Tool

## Enhanced Vision:
A revolutionary tool that surpasses existing solutions by combining:

### What Makes Us Better Than Others:

#### 1. Multi-Engine Intelligence
- John the Ripper + Hashcat integration (most tools use only one)
- Automatic engine selection based on hash type and resources
- Fallback strategies when one engine fails
- Performance optimization per hash type

#### 2. Advanced Hash Detection (200+ formats)
- Multiple detection methods: Length, charset, pattern, hashid, custom
- Confidence scoring for hash type identification
- Custom format support for CTF/obscure hashes
- Salt extraction and handling

#### 3. Adaptive Cracking Strategy
- Smart attack progression: Dictionary → Rules → Hybrid → Brute Force
- Context-aware wordlists: CTF-specific, domain-specific, language-specific
- Learning system: Remember successful patterns
- Resource optimization: CPU/GPU utilization

#### 4. CTF-Team Focused Features
- Real-time collaboration: Multiple team members, live updates
- Hint system: Contextual suggestions based on CTF category
- Progress sharing: Live status for team coordination
- Result database: Avoid re-cracking known hashes

#### 5. Smart Wordlist Management
- Auto-download common wordlists (RockYou, SecLists, CTF-specific)
- Contextual generation: Company names, dates, variations
- Optimal selection: Based on hash type and context
- Custom wordlist creation from user input

#### 6. Real-time Progress & ETA
- WebSocket-based live updates
- Accurate ETA calculation based on current speed
- Visual progress bars and statistics
- Background processing with notifications

#### 7. Result Caching & Intelligence
- Persistent cache of cracked hashes
- Pattern recognition for similar hashes
- Export capabilities: JSON, CSV, PDF reports
- Search and filter results
