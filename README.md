# HashCrack

Client-side hash cracking tool for CTF players and security professionals.

## Features

- **Client-side processing**: All computation happens in your browser
- **Multiple hash algorithms**: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA224, SHA384
- **Built-in wordlists**: 10K, 100K, and RockYou wordlists included
- **Custom wordlist support**: Upload your own wordlists (.txt files)
- **Multi-threaded**: Uses Web Workers for parallel processing
- **Real-time progress**: Live status updates and attempt counters

## Supported Hash Types

- MD5
- SHA1  
- SHA256
- SHA512
- SHA224
- SHA384

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darkmintis/HashCrack.git
   cd HashCrack
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve with a web server

3. Enter a hash, select wordlists, and start cracking

## Usage

1. **Enter Hash**: Paste the hash you want to crack
2. **Select Wordlists**: Choose from built-in wordlists or upload custom ones
3. **Start Cracking**: Click the crack button and monitor progress
4. **View Results**: Successful cracks are displayed with statistics

## Wordlists

The tool includes several built-in wordlists:

- `10k.txt` - Common passwords (10,000 entries)
- `100k.txt` - Extended password list (100,000 entries)  
- `rockyou1.txt` - RockYou dataset part 1
- `rockyou2.txt` - RockYou dataset part 2

You can also upload custom wordlists in .txt format.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Hash Library**: CryptoJS for cryptographic functions
- **Processing**: Web Workers for multi-threaded cracking
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for results persistence

## Performance

- **MD5**: ~500K attempts/second (4-core CPU)
- **SHA256**: ~150K attempts/second (4-core CPU)  
- **SHA512**: ~80K attempts/second (4-core CPU)
- **Memory usage**: <100MB for large wordlists
- **Load time**: <2 seconds for 500MB wordlist

## Adding New Hash Types

To add support for additional hash algorithms:

1. Update `detectHashType()` in `js/hash-cracker.js`
2. Add the hash function to the `hashFunctions` object
3. Test with known hash samples
