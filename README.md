| SHA512 | 128 characters, hexadecimal | `b109f3bbbc244eb82441917ed06d618b9008dd09b3befd1b5e07394c706a8bb980b1d7785e5976ec049b46df5f1326af5a2ea6d103fd07c95385ffab0cacbc86` |
| MD5 Crypt | Starts with `$1$` | `$1$salt$hash` |
| bcrypt | Starts with `$2a$` or `$2b$` | `$2a$10$salt_and_hash` |
| SHA-256 Crypt | Starts with `$5$` | `$5$salt$hash` |
| SHA-512 Crypt | Starts with `$6$` | `$6$salt$hash` |
| NTLM | 32 characters | `8846F7EAEE8FB117AD06BDD830B7586C` |
| MySQL-SHA1 | Format: `*<40 HEX CHARS>` | `*2470C0C06DEE42FD1618BB99005ADCA2EC9D1E19` |
| PBKDF2 | Format varies with implementation | `$pbkdf2$iterations$salt$hash` |
| yescrypt | Modern password hashing | `$y$params$salt$hash` |
| Argon2 | Winner of PHC competition | `$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$salt$hash` |
| scrypt | Memory-hard hashing function | `$scrypt$params$salt$hash` |
| NetNTLMv2 | Windows authentication | `hash:challenge` |
| WPA-PMKID | WiFi password hashing | `pmkid*mac1*mac2` |

### Computationally Intensive Hash Types

The following hash types are also supported but may be slower in browser environments:

| Hash Type | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| KeePass KDBX | Password manager format | CPU intensive |
| 7z | Archive format | CPU intensive |
| RAR5 | Archive format | CPU intensive |
| PDF | Document encryption | CPU intensive |

> **Note**: For the memory-hard functions (Argon2, scrypt, yescrypt), we use high-iteration PBKDF2 as a fallback in browser environments where WebAssembly modules may not be fully supported. This approach provides compatibility while maintaining reasonable security.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darkmintis/HashCrack.git
   cd HashCrack
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve with a web server

3. Enter a hash, select wordlists, and start cracking

## Usage

1. **Enter Hash**: Paste the hash you want to crack
2. **Select Wordlists**: Choose from built-in wordlists or upload custom ones
3. **Start Cracking**: Click the crack button and monitor progress
4. **View Results**: Successful cracks are displayed with statistics

## Wordlists

The tool includes several built-in wordlists:

- `10k.txt` - Common passwords (10,000 entries)
- `100k.txt` - Extended password list (100,000 entries)  
- `rockyou1.txt` - RockYou dataset part 1
- `rockyou2.txt` - RockYou dataset part 2

You can also upload custom wordlists in .txt format.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Hash Library**: CryptoJS for cryptographic functions
- **Processing**: Web Workers for multi-threaded cracking
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for results persistence
